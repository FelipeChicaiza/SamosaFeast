When the user has 10 samosas, they can buy a Double Stuffed upgrade, which produces double the amount of samosas per click.
When the user has 100 samosas, they can buy the Party Pack upgrade, which produces 5x the amount of samosas per click.
When the user has 1000 samosas, they can buy the Full Feast upgrade, which produces 10x the amount of samosas per click.

The game continues on forever and the user can continue to gain gigantic amounts of samosas. Yum!
